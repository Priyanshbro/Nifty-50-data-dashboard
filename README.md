# Nifty-50-data-dashboard
The data set used consists of information about the top 50 stocks listed on the National stock exchange of India, for everyday from 2000-2021.
The information of each stock is classified date wise, and consists of useful monetary information such as volume weighted average price of the stock, or the highest price of the stock, on a particular day.
Each stock can be classified into a sector which gives us useful insight.
Through these insights we can determine and compare the trends through each government.
Our data set enables us to visualize over 20 years of data from various sectors and over various governments and finance ministers.
We choose this particular data set because of the large disparity, in the participation of the stock market in India compared to other countries, as only 3.7% people in India own stocks.
Today India is the 7th largest stock market in the world, and yet very few people have access to information and data about it.
